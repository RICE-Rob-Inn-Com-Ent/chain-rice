- **Architecture:**
  - React 18 with TypeScript
  - React Router for navigation
  - TanStack Query for data fetching
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Framer Motion for animations

- **Key Features:**
  - Protected and public route handling
  - Authentication flow
  - Modern UI components
  - Responsive design
  - Toast notifications

- **Pages Structure:**
  - Home, Login, Register (public)
  - Dashboard, Cats, Breeding, Marketplace (protected)
  - Tournament, Wallet, Profile, Settings

## 📊 Database Schema Design

### User Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- username, email (Unique)
- hashed_password
- wallet_address (Blockchain integration)
- game_data (level, experience, mwt_balance)
- profile_info (display_name, avatar_url, bio)
- settings (notifications, privacy)
- timestamps (created_at, updated_at, last_login)
```

### Smart Contract State
- Minter configuration for game features
- Game configuration (costs, rewards)
- User game data and activity logs
- Breeding pairs and tournament info
- Staking information

## 🎮 Game Mechanics Implementation

### Cat Management System
1. **Collection:** Users can own multiple cats with unique attributes
2. **Energy System:** Cats have energy that depletes with activities
3. **Feeding:** Restore cat energy using MWT tokens
4. **Playing:** Earn MWT tokens by playing with cats
5. **Training:** Improve cat attributes through training
6. **Breeding:** Combine cats to create new offspring (planned)

### Token Economics
- **MWT Token:** Native currency for all game activities
- **Earning:** Play with cats, win tournaments, complete quests
- **Spending:** Feed cats, breed cats, enter tournaments
- **Staking:** Stake tokens for passive rewards

### Progression System
- **Cat Levels:** Improve through activities and care
- **Attributes:** Cuteness, Playfulness, Intelligence
- **Rarity Tiers:** Common → Rare → Epic → Legendary
- **User Level:** Based on experience from activities
